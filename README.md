Simple Angular Frontend Web UI Interface to operate [Kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/). This tools lets you perform basic operations around `Virtual Machines`, `Virtual Machine Instances`, `Virtual Machine Pools` and `Disks`. As the tool grew, other features got added like `Load Balancing`, `Auto Scaling`, `Monitoring` and `Cluster API` support. This tool was built initially based on requirements I had for my own environment at home and started growing as needed.  
For a Quick Start, go to our website [https://kubevirt-manager.io/](https://kubevirt-manager.io/)  
  
  If you are using the tool, please help us by providing feedback [here](https://forms.gle/dGMmswVYjNGCk2jNA).

*WARNING:* Use it at your own risk.

## INTRODUCTION

I've created this Frontend for `KubeVirt` while I was trying to learn a little bit of `Angular`. Basically this tool uses `kubectl proxy` to proxy API requests to `kubeapiserver`. To handle the `Disk`/`Volume` part, the tool works through [CDI](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/). As the time passed by, support for other features like `HPA`, `Services`, `Prometheus` and `Cluster API` were added.  
For a Quick Start, go to our website [https://kubevirt-manager.io/](https://kubevirt-manager.io/) as we provide a [bundled.yaml](kubernetes/bundled.yaml) file that has the basic setup.

## REQUIREMENTS

These are the **minimum** requirements to have the system running.  
Kubevirt featureGate `ExpandDisks` is **required**.

`CDI` is **required** with featureGate `HonorWaitForFirstConsumer` active: 
```
  config:
    featureGates:
    - HonorWaitForFirstConsumer
```

StorageClass feature `allowVolumeExpansion` is **required**:
```
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

If you are using hostpath-provisioner or any other local node storage, you will need to use `WaitForFirstConsumer`:
```
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

*Note: These settings are required to work with a hostpath csi driver, in order to prevent virtual machine instances from being started in a node different from the node in which the disk/volume resides.*

## HOW TO INSTALL IT

### Create the Namespace
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ns.yaml
```
### Create the Custom Resource Definition
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/crd.yaml
```
### Create the Service Account and RBAC
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/rbac.yaml
```
### Create the FrontEnd Deployment
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```
### Create the Priority Classes
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/pc.yaml
```
### Create the FrontEnd Service
```sh
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
```

## PROMETHEUS INTEGRATION

To integrate `kubevirt-manager` with `prometheus`, you need to edit `kubernetes/prometheus-config.yaml` and adjust your endpoint on line 21.
After adjusting the endpoint, apply the configmap:
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/prometheus-config.yaml
```

This integration was tested using `prometheus-operator`. A `ServiceMonitor` descriptor to integrate `KubeVirt` with `prometheus-operator` has been provided as an example at `kubernetes/servicemonitor.yaml`. Note that you need to set the `namespace` on the `ServiceMonitor` accordingly and you need to update your `KubeVirt` resource to reflect the `namespace` as well:
```
spec:
  monitorNamespace: monitoring
```

You will need to restart (delete) the `Pod` or redeploy the solution for the changes to take effect.

*Note:* The tool assumes Prometheus is exposing the following metrics: kubevirt_vmi_storage_write_traffic_bytes_total, kubevirt_vmi_storage_read_traffic_bytes_total, kubevirt_vmi_network_transmit_bytes_total, kubevirt_vmi_network_receive_bytes_total, kube_pod_container_resource_requests and kubevirt_vmi_memory_domain_total_bytes. These metrics are exposed by `KubeVirt` and `kube-state-metrics`.  
*Note:* Due to the introduction of NGINX Authentication support, the configmap changed a bit, make sure you review it.

## CLUSTER-API INTEGRATION  

To use `kubevirt-manager` with `cluster-api-provider` for `KubeVirt` you must install Cluster API.   
Check [Cluster API Introduction](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) for more information.   
Feature `ClusterResourceSet` is **required** by the tool to automate CNI and Add-ons fuctionality on `Standard` clusters. Either enable it before installing `Cluster API` by following the documentation on [ClusterResourceSet](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/cluster-resource-set.html) and export `EXP_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_SET=true` before running `clusterctl generate`, or enable it by adding `ClusterResourceSet=true` to the `feature-gates` argument line of your already running `capi-controller-manager` Deployment. Don't forget to wait for `capi-controller-manager` pods to restart or restart it manually if needed. The following can be done with a command like the below: 
```sh
$ kubectl edit -n capi-system deployment.apps/capi-controller-manager
```   

*Note:* Pre-baked images are provided from kubevirt-manager.online domain.  
*Note:* Pre-baked images were created using [image-builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) project.  
*Note:* Pre-baked images have `qemu-guest-agent` pre installed to provide instance details on dashboard.  
*Note:* CNI files are also provided from kubevirt-manager.online domain.  
*Note:* CNI files were mostly generated from original Helm Charts using `helm template`.   
*Note:* CNI files have some value substituion before applying to the cluster in order to support user customization.   
*Note:* The supported CNIs can be found [here](https://kubevirt-manager.online/cni-versions.json).   
*Note:* Features are also provided as YAML files from kubevirt-manager.online domain.   
*Note:* Features files were mostly generated from original Helm Charts using `helm template`.    
*Note:* The supported features can be found [here](https://kubevirt-manager.online/features.json).   

## NGINX AUTHENTICATION

To add `nginx` with `basic-auth`, you need to edit `kubernetes/auth_secret.yaml` and add your htpasswd file contents in base64 to the secret. The provided example has a single entry which username is `admin` and password is `admin`. You are encouraged to create your own file and replace in the secret.  
An example of how to get the base64 of your file is:
```sh
$ cat htpasswd-file | base64 -w0
```
After adjusting secret contents, apply the configmap and the secret:
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/auth-config.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/auth-secret.yaml
```

You will need to restart (delete) the `Pod` or redeploy the solution for the changes to take effect.

*Note:* If you had previous versions of Prometheus integration make sure `proxy_set_header Authorization "";` is present on your Prometheus `ConfigMap`. 
You may use `kubernetes/prometheus-config.yaml` as a reference to make sure your `ConfigMap` looks ok.  
*Note:* You may also want to check [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html) documentation for extra help on creating and managing the file.

## HOW TO USE IT

The recommended way to use this tool is through an `Ingress` or a `Service`.  
You can also use `kubectl port-forward` on port 8080.

*Note:* As the tool needs Websocket support, if you are using an `Ingress` make sure you set it up accordingly.
